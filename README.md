# Goal 
The purpose of this repo is to store all my notes when reading the book of Bjarne Stroustrup - Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, 3rd Edition. 

One of my reading principles is to summarize and take notes in my languague. It helps me articulate the ideas and memorize the concepts longer. 

Before I jump into coding, I always to make sure that I understand the concepts clearly.

Apart from that, I'd like to share my take on drills, exercises and try this parts. They are just my take and I'd like to have discussions if anyone is interested in it.

# Contents
The content of this repo contains 4 main parts. Each chaper has the same folder structures.
1. Drills
2. Exercises
3. Try This
4. Notes

Here are the exact words of the author about drills, exercises and try this.
<ul>
    <li> <b>Drills</b>: A drill is a very simple exercise devised to develop practical, almost mechanical skills. A drill usually consists of a sequence of modifications of a single program. You should do every drill. A drill is not asking for deep understanding, cleverness, or initiative. We consider the drills part of the basic fabric of the book. If you haven’t done the drills, you have not “done” the book.
    </li>
<li> <b>Exercises </b>: Some exercises are trivial, and others are very hard, but most are intended to leave some scope for initiative and imagination. If you are serious, you’ll do quite a few exercises. At least do enough to know which are difficult for you. Then do a few more of those. That’s how you’ll learn the most. The exercises are meant to be manageable without exceptional cleverness, rather than to be tricky puzzles. However, we hope that we have provided exercises that are hard enough to challenge anybody and enough exercises to exhaust even the best student’s available time. We do not expect you to do them all, but feel free to try.
</li> 
<li> <b>Try this </b>: Some people like to put the book aside and try some examples before reading to the end of a chapter; others prefer to read ahead to the end before trying to get code to run. To support readers with the former preference, we provide simple suggestions for practical work labeled Try this at natural breaks in the text. A Try this is generally in the nature of a drill but focused narrowly on the topic that precedes it. If you pass a Try this without trying it out – maybe because you are not near a computer or you find the text riveting – do return to it when you do the chapter drill; a Try this either complements the chapter drill or is a part of it.
