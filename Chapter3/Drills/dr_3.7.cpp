/*
[7] Add a unit to each double entered; that is, enter values such as 
10cm, 2.5in, 5ft, or 3.33m. Accept the four units: cm, m, in, ft. 
Assume conversion factors 1m==100cm, 1in==2.54cm, 1ft==12in. Read the 
unit indicator into a string. You may consider 12 m (with a space between
 the number and the unit) equivalent to 12m (without a space).
