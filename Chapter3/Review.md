<b>[1] What is a computation? </b>
</br>
Computation is an act of producing an output given an input for example give a square function an input 7 and then it produces 49 as an output. We call the process computation

<b>[2] What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation? Give examples. </b>
</br>
There are 2 main meanings for inputs and outputs </br>
- Inputs: what enters a computer and another meaning is information enters a part of a program (in this case we often call arguments)
- Outputs: what comes out a computer and another meaning is information produced by a part of a program (in this case we often call results)

</br>
<b>[3] What are the three requirements a programmer should keep in mind when expressing computations? </b>
</br>
Correctly, simply and efficiently.
</br>
</br>

<b>[4] What does an expression do?</b>
</br>
an expression computes a value out of operands using operators.
</br>
</br>
<b> [5] What is the difference between a statement and an expression, as described in this chapter?</b>
</br>
The main difference is that expression only computes a value and statement causes some effects to the program's states. 

<b>[6] What is an lvalue? List the operators that require an lvalue. Why do these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue? </b>
</br>

<b>[7] What is a constant expression?</b>
</br>
constant expression is a value does not change during the computation.

<b>[8] What is a literal?</b>
</br>
