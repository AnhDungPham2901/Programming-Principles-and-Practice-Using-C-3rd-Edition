- assignment: giving a variable new value

- definition: statement to define a variable

- operation: actions we perform on variable's value using operators. for example substraction, write to output stream, read from input stream, etc.

- cin: standard character input stream for reading value from input stream into a variable

- increment: increase value of a variable by an amount

- operator: notations such as +, -, *, /, etc

- concatenation: combine multiple strings int one string

- initialization: giving a variable an initial value

- type: defines set of values and set of operations for an object

- conversion: the process of changing type of variables.

- name: giving variables names so that we can remember and refer them

- type safety: following rules of types

- declaration: giving an object a name and a type

- narrowing: convert big type to smaller type

- value: data item that we put into a variable 

- decrement: decrease value of a variable by an amount

- object: memory region that holds a value of a type

- variable: named object

- widening: convert small type to big type

- truncation: rounding down towards zero rather than 4/5 rounding. for example 2.7 --> 0.7 is thrown away.

- int: interger type

- double: double precision floating-point

- string: type for strings

- auto: deduce type

- ==: equal operator

- !=: not equal operator

- =: assignment operator

- ++: increment operator

- < : less than operator

- <=: less than or equal operator

- ">": greater than operator

- ">=": greater than or equal operator
