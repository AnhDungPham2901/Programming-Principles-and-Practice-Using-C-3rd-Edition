/*
Are the results the same? The same execpt the ratio
Should they be? yes they should be the same. Because no matter our program is, when user 
input 2 5, the ratio must be 0.4 intead of 0 as the 2.4 program.

Whatâ€™s the difference?
2.4 int/int applies int division so narrowing converstions. We dont have this problem 
with 2.5 program when we use double to store the numbers.
