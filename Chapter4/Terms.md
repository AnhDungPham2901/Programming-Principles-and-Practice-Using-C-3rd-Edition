- argument error: arguments does not follow the precondition
- exception: error thrown by a function when it detects an error
- requirement: specification or expectation of final progrogram.
- assertion: asserts invariant (conditions that always hold)
- invariant: condition that always hold suchs as arguments must always be positive.
- run-time error: errors happen by the time of running program. 
- catch: handle the exception thrown.
- link-time error: errors found by linker such as declared but not defined
- syntax error: dont conform the language specification
- compile-time error: errors found by compiler such as syntax errors and type errors
- logic error: program runs but it does not produce output or produce wrong output
- testing: the systematic way to search errors 
- container: a collection of data such as vector, array, etc.
- postcondition: expectation of return value
- throw: use to return an exception
- debugging: the process of finding root causes of an error
- precondition: expectation of function arguments
- type error: defined type and assigned type is different such as define return type int for a function but use double type for the function
- error: unexpected outputs
- range error: errors thrown by subscript function when out of index access
- expect(): the function that can help us seperate pre/post condition vs actual code of the function
