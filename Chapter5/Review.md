<b>[1] What do we mean by “Programming is understanding”? </b>
Programing is the process of refining our idea, clarifying to understand exactly the problem that we are solving and try to express correctly. Thats the meaning of undersanding here.s

<b>[3] How do you break a problem up into smaller manageable parts? </b>
- We can ask colleagues, experienced person who can help us find approriate tools, libraries to solve our problem.
- We can identify parts that can be solved seperately. We can leverage across our program or even other programs. How to identify that parts -> that needs experience.

<b>[4] Why is creating a small, limited version of a program a good idea?</b>
Because with the small, limited version, we can understand the problem at the level more deeply and solve it effectively.  

<b>[5] Why is feature creep a bad idea?</b>
Because it increases complexity of the problem. It can create messes and make it hard to scale our solutions. We need simple, limited version to build mature parts then grow the parts into scalable solution.

<b>[6] What are the three main phases of software development?</b>
Analysis (understand problems), design (what are parts, how things are connected in our program and which tools, libraries to help structure our program), implementation (code, test, debug)

<b>[7] What is a “use case”?</b>
Use case is an example of how to use our program from the perspective of users.

<b>[8] What is the purpose of testing?</b>
Purpose of testing is make sure our program works as expected. And give us feedback to undertand more details of our problem.

<b>[13] What is a grammar? A grammar rule?</b>
A grammar is a defined syntax of input. What defines an expression? primary? or terms? 

<b>[24] When should we start testing our program?</b>
At very first stage when we have written some code after analyzing and first design. Why? because its really hard to understand our problem correctly and anticipate all the cases, so testing will give us feedbacks to understand more details of our problem.

<b>[25] What is a “user-defined type”? Why would we want one? </b>
besides built-in type, we can have user-defined type. We would want one because we never know which types do we need, so we need to have the flexibility to define our types. And the types are given data and operations that we can perform on it.

<b>[26] What is the interface to a C++ “user-defined type”? </b>
thats what we define inside public of user-defined types using class. The interface provides only useful or needed functions for end users to use.

<b>[27] Why do we want to rely on libraries of code? </b>
Because we save our time from inventing the wheel. And someone has thought about that part throughly than us when we just jump to a problem. But choosing a good liabrary to use is not an easy task.
