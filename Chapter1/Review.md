<b>[1] What is the purpose of the “Hello, World!” program? </b>
It displays "Hello World!" to the screen <br>
<b>[2] Name the four parts of a function? </b>
return type, function name, parameter list and function body <br>
<b>[3] Name a function that must appear in every C++ program. </b>
its main function. Because the system must find this function to start the program <br>
<b>[4] In the “Hello, World!” program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;? </b>
To notify the system that it's run successfully. <br>
<b>[5] What is the purpose of the compiler?</b>
It translates the source code into object file. In other words it tranlates human readable language into machine language. <br>
<b>[6] What is the purpose of the import statement? </b>
it gives us accessability to libraries <br>
<b>[7] What is the purpose of the #include directive? </b>
Its similar purpose with import, new version of C++ supports import, and the older one supports include. import brings more optimization. <br>
<b>[8] What does a .cpp suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++? </b>

<b>[9] What does the linker do for your program? </b>

<b>[10] What is the difference between a source file and an object file?</b>
The source file is read and written by human, the object file is for machine to "understand" and execute <br>
<b>[11] What is an executable?</b>
The result of linking object files <br>
<b>[12] What is an IDE and what does it do for you?</b>
It gives an editor for writing and editting code. The editor supports color code and format to help us write code more effectively. It also provides debuggining tool to help us find errors easier. It also support compile program with single "run" button instead of we type manually to compile our program. <br>

<b>[13] How do you get a compiled program to run?</b>
Just type its name in the command line. 
<br>

<b>[14] What is a comment?</b>
Explanation of our statements in our programs to help human read the program easier. <br>

<b>[15] What is the purpose of a drill? </b>
Establish and reinforce practical programming skills. And give us the experience with programming environment tools.  <br>

<b>[16] If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice? </b>
Because learning programing by practicing, it is like a sports or learning instruments. We must practice. <br>
