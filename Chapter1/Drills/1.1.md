How to make the program run

## Install G++ for mac
1. Install Homebrew if not yet
2. brew install gcc
With mac silicon chip. it stores inside /opt/homebrew/bin
3. Check the version of g+++ inside the path
4. at this moment we have 2 g++, if we type g++ in the command, it shows the default version of MAC installed with clang
This version sits at the path: /user/bin/g++ (check by using which g++)
5. We need to change the g++ points to the /opt/homebrew/bin/gcc++-15 instead (the version number depends on which version we have just downloaded)
6. link command: ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/g++-15 /opt/homebrew/bin/g++
If it shows the error: File exists. then use
sudo ln -sf /opt/homebrew/bin/g++-15 /opt/homebrew/bin/g++
7. Export path and refresh: echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
8. Now we check with commands: which g++, g++ --version.
